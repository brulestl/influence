- This script is not defined in package.json

### 5. Frontend Linting (`npm run lint`)

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Installed `react-test-renderer` and `@expo/metro-runtime`
2. **Jest Configuration**: Fixed module name mapping and test path exclusions
3. **ESLint Setup**: Created complete ESLint configuration for API
4. **TypeScript Configuration**: Updated to include test files
5. **System Dependencies**: Installed `xdg-utils` for browser opening functionality

## Recommendations

1. **Add Frontend Linting**: Set up ESLint for the React Native frontend
2. **Add E2E Testing**: Consider adding Playwright or Detox for end-to-end testing
3. **CI/CD Integration**: These commands should be integrated into CI/CD pipeline
4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding test coverage reporting

## Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The project is ready for synchronization and deployment. All critical tests are passing and the development server is functional.
